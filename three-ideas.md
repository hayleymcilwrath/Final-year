# First Idea

### Overview
My first idea is an e-book designed to help distract children going through procedures/treatments in hospitals. As well as having a colourful, vivid story I want to create an experience for the child/patient. Each individual story will come with a pack of products that the child can actually hold/touch/smell/interact to bring the story to life.

### Pros
 • This e-book will help play specialists/parents/nursing staff distract their clients during invasive procedures and help take their minds off the treatment they're receiving. This will help relax the child and make the process quicker, less stressful for all involved and gain consent for treatment easier.Also lessening the need for restraint.

### Cons
 • The age range for this product is vast and needs to be reflected in the e book.
 • Not one ebook will do all ages and interests. 
 • I need to start with one age range and the product can be expanded from there.

### How might it be built?
For the ebook I have now stumbled upon, from a great source!!, Mark and Emma Boulton’s Creating eBooks, I’ve been told it is a great overview so I intend to start here with the ebook.

### Who’s it for?
 • The target audience would be initially for children aged 4-10 years old as research shows this is the age that children can most easily be distracted with interactive toys. I also feel this is the age children are most confused by hospitals and need encouragement and definitely distraction when going through invasive treatment or procedures.
 • This e-book will also be for hospital professionals i.e. play specialists/doctor surgeries and parents to purchase and use during hospital /doctor surgery visits.

### What’s the business model?
 • I foresee parents and or healthcare professional will pay for this service.
 • I intend the one off cost to include a sensory bag that is posted out to you. I'm unsure at present how much to charge for the downloading of the book. This will be determined after deciding and sourcing the various materials needed for the sensory bag.
 • I’d need to test my ideas with some user-centred research, but I believe there is a business model here.


# Second idea

### Overview
My second idea is an app that can be downloaded in hospitals to reduce stress and help calm children/vulnerable adults. The app will include different mini games that will be hospital related to introduce information on admission, procedures and treatment in a fun way. The app could be designed to provide child friendly information in one specially i.e. cancer treatments or more general like a blood test.

### Pros
 • This app is going to not only help distract children/vulnerable adults through procedures but also help keep them entertained in waiting areas and during ward stays. 
 • The medical information provided will need to be accurate and age appropriate. 

### Cons
 • Medical procedures change so the app would need to be constantly updated.  • The procedures can vary from hospital to hospital so the app would need to be able to reflect his. 
 • Medical terminology would need to be researched and accurate. This can constantly change and the app would need to be updated on a regular basis.

### How might it be built?
I plan that this will be an IOS app, designed for Apple. This project will give me an opportunity to learn about designing an IOS app. If it goes well I would then develop this for android.


### Who’s it for?
 • The target audience would initially be directed to hospital clients aged 3-10 years. Vulnerable adults would also be able to use this app as it would be delivered to their appropriate understanding level. 
 • Parents could buy and download the app before planned hospital admissions.
 • I would imagine that health care establishments with iPads/tablets would also use this app to include it in their client treatment/information plan.

### What’s the business model?
I foresee parents and or healthcare professional will pay for this service.
I intend the one off cost to download the app. I'm unsure at present how much to charge for the downloading of the app. Premium levels can be purchased to further the client experience, this would include advanced mini games and a journal/sketch book.
I’d need to test my ideas with some user-centred research, but I believe there is a business model here.


# Third idea
### Overview
I grew up learning about different life experiences through Biff and Chip. They went to school, to the dentist, got a new brother, a pet etc......all through a simple illustrative hard back book. I still remember some of the stories toady! I would like to maintain the same concept of two/three loved characters that children can identify with and grow to love. They would teach them about the world around us but update the idea to the 21st century. My idea would eventually include a package of ebooks, apps and puppets that would evolve around two characters Rosie and Poppy and their friend Bobbi. They would be aimed to help children experience different issues in life like potty training, first day at nursery school, going to the doctors, going to hospital, going to the dentist etc. Another element to the business would be apps, ebooks and puppets designed to give the same information but on a level relevant for children with ASD, (Autism Spectrum Disorder).

### Pros
 •  My mum is a qualified play specialist and at present a play-school teacher. She has nearly 20 years extensive knowledge in distraction applications and how to transfer information to children at their level. It will be amazing to work alongside her gaining as much information as I can for this project.
 • A business idea that has endless possibilities for both education, healthcare and parents to be interested in and buy.
 • I have never designed an e-book and would enjoy the challenge of learning something new.
 • I can put my passion for illustration into a business venture.

### Cons
 • Going up against similar products on the market.
 • Getting the right social media publicity needed to launch new characters and make them go viral.
 • Not just books involved, I would need to source other businesses to make puppets, source items for sensory bags.
 • Huge business model for someone to start who has never had a business before.

### How might it be built?
My intention is to create an ePub/ebooks author and .mobi format. This is going to be a new challenge for me as I have never used these types of software before. I have however some experience of creating narrative storylines. I have now stumbled upon from a great source!!, Mark and Emma Boulton’s Creating eBooks, I’ve been told it is a great overview so i intend to start here with the ebook.

### Who’s it for?
The ebooks, app and puppets would be aimed to help children experience different issues in life like potty training, first day at nursery school, going to the doctors, going to hospital, going to the dentist etc. Another element to the business would be apps, ebooks and puppets designed to give the same information but on a level relevant for children with ASD, (Autism Spectrum Disorder).

### What’s the business model?
I envisage that parents, schools and healthcare providers would be interested in purchasing the ebooks, app and puppets depending on the story. 
There would be a one off fee for each book download with the option to purchase an app and puppet relevant to that story.
